# Backtracking

> Backtracking inherently uses DFS

The technique to write a Backtracking solution has 4 steps:
1. Check the boundaries and conditions
2. Process the node(s) (if required)
3. Call the neighbours/next possible value
4. Reverse the operation(s) done in step 2

> It helps to understand the backtracking question, if we draw a horizontal tree on paper with all the calls and processing done by the required question.
