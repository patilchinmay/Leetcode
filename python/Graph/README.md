# Graph Techniques

##  DFS

> Most of the graph traversal questions can be solved by DFS

To check if DFS applies, we have to understand following:
- Do we not have all the information related to graph
- Do we need to visit all the nodes in graph to gather the required information

The technique to write a DFS solution has 3 steps:
1. Check the boundaries and conditions
2. Process the node
3. Call the neighbours 

Make sure to include all the conditions in the first step so that we do not need to specify the condition in step 3 and we can just call the neighbours w/o any condition.
